# latex2pngs

A LaTeX document for just equations and a script to convert them to separate PNGs.

I always forget how to do this so now it's in one place finally!

HOW TO:
-------

1. Generate your PDF from the LaTeX file. Samples provided.
2. Call `./convert2pngs.sh` after changing the PDF filename.


Dependencies:
-------------

You must install `poppler` and `imagemagick` for the BASH script to work.
